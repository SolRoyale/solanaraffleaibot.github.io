4. Transfer sufficient funds of SOL to your new Solana wallet.
5. Access Sol Royale Bot on Telegram.\
   Select the "Enter" button. Sol Royale Bot will assign you a "seat" where you will be given 2 minutes to pay the entry fee to be admitted into the new Pre-Game Lobby Group.\
   You must send payment from the SAME WALLET ADDRESS you attached to Sol Royale Bot, otherwise, the transaction cannot be verified.\
   Do not navigate away from this panel or type any commands when trying to make payment.\
   Make payment first, and once it has been confirmed, you may navigate away as you please.\
   If you take too long to pay, your seat will be revoked. Do not send payment if your seat has been revoked. You will have to select "Enter Again" to receive another seat and then send payment.\
   After sending payment, please allow up to 1 minute for the transaction to be verified.
