#### Do you want to put your skills to the test and compete against others to win the ultimate Solana prize?

Sol Royale Bot is the first Telegram Solana Bot that enables users to participate in contests, raffles and games to win Solana as the prize! Sol Royale Bot enables fair participation in a simple-to-use manner and validates transactions publicly; such as, paying the winner of the contest transparently for all members to see with accompanying Solscan transaction link.

These contests can be hosted on any platform or game that the host chooses. However, for the purpose of Sol Royale Bot at this point in time, it will only be used for participants to play the online multiplayer game 'Stumble Guys'.

In order to use Sol Royale Bot, you must be subscribed to the Sol Royale Channel on Telegram.

Do not navigate away from this panel or type any commands when trying to make payment. Make payment first, and once it has been confirmed, you may navigate away as you please. You must send payment from the SAME WALLET ADDRESS you attached to Sol Royale Bot, otherwise, the transaction cannot be verified.

## FAQ

#### 1. How do I join a Sol Royale game lobby?
To join, first become a member of our main Telegram channel, where the Sol Royale Bot announces new lobbies. When a lobby opens, select the "Attach Wallet Address" button and input your Solana wallet address (NOT your private key). You will also need to create a USERNAME which should match your Steam username. Then, select the "Enter" button to claim a seat. You have 2 minutes to send the entry fee to secure your unique one-time link to the Pre-Game Lobby Group.

#### 2. Why do I need to input my Solana wallet address? 
Your Telegram account will have an assigned chat ID after interacting with Sol Royale Bot. We use your wallet address to verify your payment and to link it to your Telegram account (chat ID). This ensures accurate transaction tracking and ensuring that prizes are paid to the correct winner. Please note that the entry fee MUST be paid from the Solana wallet address you have attached to Sol Royale Bot.

#### 3. How does the payment verification process work?
After claiming a seat, send the entry fee to the Sol Royale Bot's specified wallet address (this will appear after selecting the "Enter" button). Sol Royale Bot will verify the payment amount and the account to which it was received from. Once confirmed, you will receive a unique, one-time link to join the Pre-Game Lobby Telegram Group where the in-game lobby code for the current game round will be shared!

#### 4. What if the lobby is full?
If the lobby is full, you can select the "Refresh" button and wait for a spot to open. Seats may become available if others fail to pay within the 2-minute timeframe. Select the "Enter" button again if a spot opens (e.g., 30/31 players). Otherwise, wait for the next lobby announcement.

#### 5. What happens if I don’t pay within 2 minutes?
Your seat will be revoked, and Sol Royale Bot will open it up to other players who can now enter. 

#### 6. Why do I need to change my Steam username to the same username I created with Sol Royale Bot?
This ensures that participants who have paid the entry fee are the ones participating in the round. If your Steam username does not match your USERNAME you created with Sol Royale Bot, you will be removed from the lobby. Please do not share the lobby code or you will be banned. 

#### 7. What is the entry fee, and can it be customised?
The entry fee varies depending on the round and is always displayed in each announcement of new game rounds. Higher fees result in larger prize pools, therefore larger takings for the winner of that round!

#### 8. How much are the service fees per round?
Service fees are recycled into the payment pool required to pay future winners in new rounds; as well as paying out bonus Solana prizes to regular participants. Service fees contribute towards marketing costs and software development costs to improving Sol Royale Bot's functionality. Service fees equal 0.01 sol per round and is already included within the entry fee.

#### 9. What is the bonus Solana prize for every 5th consecutive win?
Every 5th consecutive win refers to when a participant wins their 5th game, 10th game, 15th game, and so on. At every interval, this participant will receive a bonus Solana prize of 0.25 SOL.
- Total Games Won: 5 = 0.25 Bonus SOL prize!
- Total Games Won: 10 = 0.25 Bonus SOL prize!
- Total Games Won: 15 = 0.25 Bonus SOL prize!
