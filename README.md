## FAQ

#### 1. How do I join a Sol Royale game lobby?
To join, first become a member of our main Telegram channel, where the Sol Royale Bot announces new lobbies. When a lobby opens, click "Wallet Address" and input your Solana wallet address (NOT your private key). You will also need to create a USERNAME which should match the username you use within the game. Then, select the "Enter" button to claim a seat. You have 2 minutes to send the entry fee to secure your link to the Pre-Game Lobby Group.

#### 2. Why do I need to input my Solana wallet address? 
We use your wallet address to verify your payment and to link it to your Telegram account (chat ID). This ensures accurate transaction tracking and verifying payment to the correct winner. Please note that the entry fee MUST be paid from the Solana wallet address you have connected to Sol Royale Bot.

#### 3. How does the payment verification process work?
After claiming a seat, send the entry fee to the Sol Royale Bot's specified wallet address (this will appear after selecting the "Enter" button). Sol Royale Bot will verify the payment amount and the account to which it was received from. Once confirmed, you’ll receive a unique, one-time invite link to the Pre-Game Lobby Telegram Group where the lobby code for the current game round will be shared!

#### 4. What if the lobby is full?
If the lobby is full, you can select the "Refresh" button and wait for a spot to open. Seats may become available if others fail to pay within 2 minutes. Select the "Enter" button again if a spot opens (e.g., 30/31 players). Otherwise, wait for the next lobby announcement.

#### 5. What happens if I don’t pay within 2 minutes?
Your seat will be revoked, and Sol Royale Bot will open it up so that other players can enter. 

#### 6. Why do I need to change my Steam name/Game name to the same username I created with Sol Royale Bot?
This ensures that participants who have paid are the ones participating in the game. If your Steam name/Game name doesn’t match your USERNAME stated in Sol Royale Bot, you will be removed from the lobby. Please do not share the lobby code. 

#### 7. What is the entry fee, and can it be customised?
The entry fee varies depending on the game round and is always displayed in the announcement. Higher fees result in larger prize pools, therefore bigger winnings for the winner of that round!

#### 8. What is the bonus Solana prize for every 5th consecutive win?
Every 5th consecutive win refers to when a participant wins their 5th game, then their 10th game, then their 15th game, and so on. At every interval, this participant will receive a bonus Solana prize of 0.25 SOL.
- Total Games Won: 5 = 0.25 Bonus SOL prize!
- Total Games Won: 10 = 0.25 Bonus SOL prize!
- Total Games Won: 15 = 0.25 Bonus SOL prize!
