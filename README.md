## FAQ

#### How do I join a Sol Royale game lobby?
To join, first become a member of our main Telegram channel, where the Sol Royale Bot announces new lobbies. When a lobby opens, click "Wallet Address" and input your Solana wallet address (NOT your private key). You will also need to create a USERNAME which should match the username you use within the game. Then, click "Enter" to claim a seat. You have 2 minutes to send the entry fee to secure your spot.
Answer 1

#### Why do I need to input my Solana wallet address? 
We use your wallet address to verify your payment and to link it to your Telegram account (chat ID). This ensures accurate transaction tracking and verifying correct payment to the winner. Please note that the entry fee MUST be paid from the solana wallet address you have attached within the bot.
Answer 2

##### How does the payment verification process work?
After claiming a seat, send the entry fee to the specified wallet. The bot will verify the payment and memo. Once confirmed, you’ll receive a unique, one-time invite link to the Pre-Game Lobby telegram group where the lobby code will be shared!

#### What if the lobby is full?
If the lobby is full, you can click "Refresh" and wait for a spot to open. Seats may become available if others fail to pay within 2 minutes. Click "Enter" again if a spot opens (e.g., 30/31 players). Otherwise, wait for the next lobby announcement.

#### What happens if I don’t pay within 2 minutes?
Your seat will be revoked, and the bot will open it up to allow other players to enter. 

#### Why do I need to change my Steam name/Game name to my created username in the bot? 
This ensures that players who paid are the ones participating in the game. If your Steam name/Game name doesn’t match your USERNAME stated in the bot, you’ll be removed from the lobby. Please don’t share the lobby code.

#### What is the entry fee, and can it be customized?
The entry fee varies depending on the game lobby and is shown in the announcement. Higher fees result in larger prize pools!
