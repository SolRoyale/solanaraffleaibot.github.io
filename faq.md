# FAQ

**1. How do I join a Solana Raffle** **Round?**

To join, first become a member of our main Telegram channel, where the Solana Raffle AI Bot announces new lobbies. When a lobby opens, select the "Attach Wallet Address" button and input your Solana wallet address (NOT your private key). You will also need to create a USERNAME. Then, select the "Enter" button to claim a seat. You have 2 minutes to send the entry fee to secure your unique one-time link to the Pre-Game Lobby Group.

**2. Why do I need to input my Solana wallet address?**

Your Telegram account will have an assigned chat ID after interacting with Solana Raffle AI Bot. We use your wallet address to verify your payment and to link it to your Telegram account (chat ID). This ensures accurate transaction tracking and that prizes are paid to the correct winner. Please note that the entry fee MUST be paid from the Solana wallet address you have attached to Solana Raffle AI Bot.

**3. How does the payment verification process work?**

After claiming a seat, send the entry fee to the Solana Raffle AI Bot's specified wallet address (this will appear after selecting the "Enter" button). Solana Raffle AI Bot will verify the payment amount and the account to which it was received from. Once confirmed, you will receive a unique, one-time link to join the Pre-Game Lobby Telegram Group.

**4. What if the lobby is full?**

If the lobby is full, you can select the "Refresh" button and wait for a spot to open. Seats may become available if others fail to pay within the 2-minute timeframe. Select the "Enter" button again if a spot opens (e.g., 30/31 players). Otherwise, wait for the next lobby announcement.

**5. What happens if I donâ€™t pay within 2 minutes?**

Your seat will be revoked, and Solana Raffle AI Bot will open it up to other players who can now enter.

**6. What is the entry fee, and can it be customised?**

The entry fee varies depending on the round and is always displayed in each announcement of new game rounds. Higher fees result in larger prize pools, therefore larger takings for the winner of that round!

**7. How much are the service fees per round?**

Service fees are recycled into the payment pool required to pay future winners in new rounds; as well as paying out bonus Solana prizes to regular participants. Service fees contribute towards marketing costs and software development costs to improving Solana Raffle AI Bot's functionality. Service fees equal 0.01 sol per round and is already included within the entry fee.

**8. What is the bonus Solana prize for every 5th consecutive win?**

Every 5th consecutive win refers to when a participant wins their 5th game, 10th game, 15th game, and so on. At every interval, this participant will receive a bonus Solana prize of 0.25 SOL.

* Total Games Won: 5 = 0.25 Bonus SOL prize!
* Total Games Won: 10 = 0.25 Bonus SOL prize!
* Total Games Won: 15 = 0.25 Bonus SOL prize!
